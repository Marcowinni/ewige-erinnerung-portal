        p3: "In these moments of grief, we long for closeness, for a place where memories do not fade but live on. The idea for Memora Moments originated precisely from this experience.",
        p4: "This project was born out of love for our closest confidants and the desire to preserve their stories and uniqueness. A small gift, initially intended only for our loved ones, has shown us how valuable it can be to keep memories tangible and alive – through pictures, videos, and music that can bring back a smile.",
        p5: "Today, we want to share this opportunity with others. With our products, we create bridges between the past and the present – dignified, personal, and close to the heart. We believe that memories do not have to end with farewell. They can continue to shine, comfort us, and give us strength."
